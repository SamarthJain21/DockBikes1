Dock bikes is a project which deals with a campus problem.
The problem we are handling is connecting the whole campus with cycles. students/faculty can rent cycles from 1 hub and give it back at another (or same) hub depending on their needs(whether they want to travel/exercise) 
This will give them flexibility to reach their location at any time with any number of stops(unlike E-rickshaw).
It not only saves time but also acts as an activity.




In this project
This program is only for management and not for students
Students just require their identity slip to rent cycles after registration (by management)

Their data is linked to SQL database which monitors time in and time out and hence the payment accordingly.
